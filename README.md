# BlackjackProject

#Project Description

This program runs a Blackjack game simulator. The ACE is currently only at 11, the player does not get to choose high or low ACE.
This program uses a generated deck of cards that could be implemented in any card game, the blackjack app and parts of its program
use the "deck of cards" to play with.  

Currently in the console a print line for the dealers hand will occasionally print twice but it does not affect the game play. 

#What I learned

I was able to better understand Arraylists and how to manipulate them through multiple methods from different classes. 
I was also able to further my understanding of parent and child classes and how they use polymorphism with their properties.
